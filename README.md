Infrastructure required to use code as is  
* NodeJS hosting
* MongoDB
* public firebase bucket  
  
## Site architecture  
This site uses NodeJS with the Express framework to serve html from the back-end.  
The site also utilized EJS, which allows for me to create templates once and re-use many times.
The beer reviews and comments are stored in the MongoDB.  
The photos that users can upload with their reviews are stored in the Firebase bucket.
